          Hi there! I'm Jasper, and currently working on making this portfolio website a bit better. As of 30th August 2023, it's a little quick and dirty at the moment, but check back in a few days to see what I've done with the place! Currently I'm working on migrating my previously locally hosted projects to being web hosted so you can have a look and play around with them.
        </p>

          Unfortunately they changed the rate limit for the Taddy Podcast API after we made this - so if the search stops working, then I'm sorry! Too many people must be looking at it, and I don't want to buy a more expensive API key.

          This was originally designed to be locally hosted, as we had only been learning JavaScript for 3 weeks at the time and hadn't covered web hosting yet.

          It uses a React front-end, with a mix of regular CSS sheets and Styled Components. The back-end is an Express.js server with a REST API, connected to a PostgreSQL database. I haven't yet started hosting the back-end as I need to modify it to work with the web-hosted front-end!
